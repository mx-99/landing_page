A static landing page using **HTML** and **CSS**, replicating a sample design provided in the project. 
The focus was on layout, visual structure, and styling not on functionality or interactivity.

- Practice using:

  - Semantic HTML structure
  - CSS Flexbox for layout

#### 🛠️ Skills & Tools Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 (with Flexbox)
- Developer Tools for debugging and layout inspection

#### ✨ Notes

- This is not meant to be a pixel-perfect clone.
- The images on this page are from a collection I gathered from the internet a while ago. <br>
Unfortunately, I have forgotten the sources.
If you own one, two, or more of the images, <br> Feel free to contact me to be credited or to have them removed.
